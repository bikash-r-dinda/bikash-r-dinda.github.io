I’m **Bikash Ranjan Dinda**, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the **University of the Western Cape**, Cape Town, South Africa.  
My work explores **late-time cosmology, dark energy, and the applications of machine learning in cosmology**.  

I am broadly interested in the dynamics of the Universe on large scales, structure formation, 21 cm cosmology, weak lensing, and inflation.  
My current research focuses on combining **theoretical modeling, statistical inference, and machine learning tools** to understand the nature of cosmic acceleration.
