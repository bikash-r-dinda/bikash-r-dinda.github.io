This portfolio item showcases a research poster based on [arXiv:2407.17252](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17252), titled *Model-agnostic assessment of dark energy after DESI DR1 BAO*. The work, authored by Bikash R. Dinda and Roy Maartens, uses Gaussian Process reconstruction to analyze DESI DR1 BAO data alongside CMB and supernova observations‚Äîwithout relying on parametric dark energy models.

üîç **Poster highlights**:
- Non-parametric reconstruction of cosmological distances
- Comparison of model-agnostic \( w(z) \) with ŒõCDM and \( w_0w_a \)CDM
- Constraints on \( H_0 \), \( \Omega_m \), and \( \Omega_k \)
- Evidence suggests DESI‚Äôs signal for evolving dark energy is not robust under model-agnostic analysis
