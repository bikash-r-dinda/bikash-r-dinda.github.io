This portfolio item presents a research poster based on the work [arXiv:2407.17252](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17252), which investigates the evidence for dynamical dark energy using a **model-agnostic reconstruction** approach. The study analyzes baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI Data Release 1, combined with CMB distance priors and supernova observations, to assess the robustness of dark energy signals without assuming a specific late-time model.

üîç **Key highlights from the poster**:
- Uses Gaussian Process regression to reconstruct cosmological distance measures.
- Finds that model-agnostic evidence for dynamical dark energy is **not significant**, contrasting with results from the \( w_0w_a \)CDM model.
- Provides independent constraints on \( H_0 \) and \( \Omega_m \) that are broadly consistent with standard cosmology.

This work contributes to the ongoing debate about the nature of cosmic acceleration and the reliability of parametric dark energy models in light of new DESI data.
