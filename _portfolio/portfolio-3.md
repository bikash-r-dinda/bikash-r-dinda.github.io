This poster presents theoretical insights into how dark energy and modified gravity leave distinct signatures in the galaxy power spectrum on large cosmological scales. Based on the works [arXiv:1706.00567](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00567) and [arXiv:1607.05123](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05123), the research explores relativistic effects in galaxy clustering and their potential to distinguish between competing cosmological models.

ðŸ”­ **Key themes**:
- Incorporation of relativistic corrections in the observed galaxy power spectrum
- Sensitivity of large-scale modes to the nature of gravity and dark energy
- Use of gauge-invariant formalism to isolate observable effects
- Implications for future surveys like SKA and Euclid

ðŸ§  These studies emphasize that while standard Newtonian approximations suffice on small scales, the largest cosmological scales require a fully relativistic treatment to uncover subtle imprints of dark energy or modified gravity.
